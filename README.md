# Clinic Management

# Description
Clinic Management is a Spring Boot microservices application designed for managing healthcare operations within a clinic. This project is part of my learning journey into microservices architecture, providing features for managing patients, doctors, appointments, and a user interface. The architecture includes service registration, API gateway, and configuration management.

# Architecture
The application consists of the following components:
- **Eureka Server**: Service registry for all microservices.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized gateway for routing requests to various microservices.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for all services.
- **Patient Service**: Manages patient data and interactions.
- **Doctor Service**: Handles doctor information and schedules.
- **Appointment Service**: Manages appointments between patients and doctors.
- **UI Service**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend services.

# Features
